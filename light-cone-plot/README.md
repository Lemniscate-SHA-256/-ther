# Light Cone Plot

This project generates a light cone plot using Python and Matplotlib, featuring a Tron-inspired theme. The visual representation includes custom colors and styles that mimic the aesthetic of the Tron universe.

## Project Structure

```
light-cone-plot
├── src
│   ├── light_cone_plot.py
├── requirements.txt
└── README.md
```

## Installation

To set up the environment, ensure you have Python installed. Then, create a virtual environment and install the required dependencies:

```bash
# Create a virtual environment
python -m venv venv

# Activate the virtual environment
# On Windows
venv\Scripts\activate
# On macOS/Linux
source venv/bin/activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Running the Script

To generate the light cone plot, run the following command:

```bash
python src/light_cone_plot.py
```

## Additional Information

The light cone plot visualizes the concept of light cones in spacetime, illustrating the paths that light can take from a given event. The Tron theme enhances the visual appeal, making it a unique representation of this fundamental concept in physics.

Feel free to explore and modify the code to customize the plot further!
